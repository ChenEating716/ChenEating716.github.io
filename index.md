## Welcome to CYT_Dataset
### What is CYT_Dataset?
A product from PyBullet simulation.
CYT_Dataset contains 77 kinds of object,most of them are selected from YCB_Dataset.
For each group of data,there are 12 different kinds of objects dropping into a boxï¼Œand we put the Synthetic Camera right above the box.
So basicly,all the information come from PyBullet Synthetic Camera Rendering.

CYT_Dataset consists of five parts(RGBImages,DepthImages,SegImages,BaseandOrien and PointCloud).
#### RGBImages
100000 512*512 PNG files,containing color information. Generated by PyBullet Synthetic Camera Rendering.
#### DepthImages
100000 512*512 PNG files,containing depth information. Generated by PyBullet Synthetic Camera Rendering.
#### SegImages
100000 512*512 PNG files,containing segmetation information. Segmentation Images automaticly generated by PyBullet.
#### BaseandOrien
100000 .csv files,containing base and orientation information for each object.
#### PointCloud
100000 .ply files,containing colorful 3D point cloud information,generated from DepthImages and RGBImages.
